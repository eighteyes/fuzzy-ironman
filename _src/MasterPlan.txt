Business Plan

Mission Statement:
 MMenus provides resturaunt owners and chefs a tool to easily update their menus and make them accessible to customers.

Concept:
MMenus is a Software as a Service product that operates from an interplay between has two elements:
1) Software on a resturaunt website that detects a mobile visitor and provides a navigation overlay to common user tasks, mapping a location, calling a phone and accessing menus managed by the second element.
2) Menu Management software handles the content of a menu which consists of pictures, names, prices, categories (Appetizers, Entrees, etc) and descriptions. These can be updated on a secure website, or through regular email updates to the menu.

Potential customers trying to learn about an eatery will likely try to access the menu with a mobile phone. Universally, this is a process fraught with peril, for customers and resturaunt owners. Customers must download PDF's or attempt to read a website which is poorly formatted for mobile phones. Owners must update PDF files or work through a third party developer to update their menus.


MMenus addresses this by providing a menu service which does not replace their existing website, focuses purely on providing high-quality, easy to update menus.

Resturaunts with a menu which is formatted for mobile phones will likely be chosen by a customer merely because it's easy to access the content.

Most customers would be regular monthly subscriptions, some would require extra design or custom features, which would incur additional upfront/setup charges.

There are over 300,000 independently owned resturaunts in the US alone, and this software could easily be adapted for foreign language. Working with chains is a possibility, but it's likely it will be for a custom integration.
